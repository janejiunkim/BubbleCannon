# Bubble Cannon

Try to pop all the bubbles by color before another row is added or when you run out of moves.

# How to play
1. Aim the cannon using your W and D keys to move it left and right respectively.
2. Match the color of the loaded bubble to your target bubble to start popping similarly colored bubbles (must be at least 3).
